Student Management & Result Processing System deals with all kinds of student details, academic related record and can produce result automatically. This system tracks all the details of a student from the first day to the end day of his/her. Our project is only a humble venture to satisfy the needs in an institution. It deals with the various activities related to the students. There are mainly 3 modules in this project: Admin module, Student and Gradian module, Marks Management module. In the Project we can register as a user and user of two types, student and administrator. Administrator has the power to add new user and can edit and delete a user. A student can view their result and regular class activities and also can add, edit and delete his/her profile. The teacher can add edit and delete marks for the student. All user can see final marks of students. The main goal is to develop knowledge and skills and learn how to work as a team. Another main goal is to provide automation to the school.
